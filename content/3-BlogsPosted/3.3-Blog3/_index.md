Today, I would like to share a noteworthy feature recently announced by AWS: **Web Search on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**.

In recent years, AI Agents have become one of the fastest-growing areas of artificial intelligence. They are no longer limited to answering questions. Instead, AI Agents can plan tasks, invoke tools, access enterprise data, and perform various operations on behalf of users.

However, one major limitation of many AI Agents is that they are often constrained by their training data or the internal data provided to them. When users ask about newly released information, updated policies, new products, or recent events, an Agent may produce inaccurate or incomplete answers if it does not have access to up-to-date information.

To address this challenge, AWS introduced **Web Search on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**—a fully managed capability that enables AI Agents to retrieve current knowledge from the web, provide answers with citations, and remain within a controlled AWS environment. This feature became **Generally Available (GA)** on **June 17, 2026**.

In this article, we will explore:

- What problems does Web Search on AgentCore solve?
- What are the main components of its architecture?
- Why is this feature important for AI Agent systems?

## 1. The Problem: AI Agents Are Powerful, but They Still Need Current Knowledge

An AI Agent can be highly capable of reasoning, analysis, and task automation. However, if it is not connected to an up-to-date source of information, it will eventually encounter a familiar limitation known as **knowledge cutoff**.

This limitation becomes especially important in scenarios such as:

- Keeping up with the latest news and trends.
- Looking up product information.
- Tracking policy updates.
- Collecting market intelligence.
- Supporting research activities.
- Answering questions that require the latest sources.

Previously, solving this problem usually required engineering teams to integrate external search APIs, manage API keys, process search results, filter trustworthy sources, and control the data leaving their systems.

Although this approach works, it introduces additional challenges for organizations and enterprise systems that require strong security, including governance, operational costs, data control, and reliability.

## 2. What Is Web Search on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore?

Web Search on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is a capability that enables AI Agents to retrieve current information from the web in order to generate more well-grounded responses.

Instead of relying solely on the model's built-in knowledge, an Agent can submit a natural language query to Web Search. The service then returns relevant information, including excerpts, titles, sources, and publication dates, which the model can use when generating its response.

According to AWS, Web Search operates through **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway** together with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

The workflow can be simplified as follows:

```text

   │
   ▼
AI Agent
   │
   ▼
AgentCore Gateway
   │
   ▼
Web Search
   │
   ▼
Relevant Web Sources
   │
   ▼
Grounded Answer
```

The key point is not simply that AI can search the web. More importantly, it performs that search within an AWS-managed architecture, significantly reducing the effort required to build and maintain a custom search infrastructure from scratch.

## 3. Basic Architecture

A simplified architecture of the solution can be illustrated as follows:

```text
User
   │
   ▼
AI Agent
   │
   ▼
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
   │
   ▼
AgentCore Gateway
   │
   ▼
Web Search Tool
   │
   ▼
Current Web Knowledge
   │
   ▼
Grounded Answer with Sources
```

In this architecture:

- **AI Agent** is responsible for receiving user requests, planning tasks, and deciding when new information needs to be retrieved.

- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** is the platform for deploying and operating AI Agents at scale. AWS describes AgentCore as a collection of services that provide runtime, memory, identity, gateway, and observability capabilities for AI Agents.

- **AgentCore Gateway** acts as the connection layer between the Agent and external tools or APIs that the Agent can use.

- **Web Search Tool** is a fully managed web search capability that enables the Agent to retrieve current information without requiring developers to build an entire search infrastructure.

- **Grounded Answer** is the final response generated using the retrieved information rather than relying solely on the model's existing knowledge.

## 4. What Makes This Feature Stand Out?

The most significant advantage of Web Search is that it enables AI Agents to move beyond answering questions based only on previously learned information.

With traditional AI Agents, when users ask about newly published information, the system usually has only two options:

- Refuse to answer.
- Provide an answer with a certain level of uncertainty.

With Web Search, the Agent can proactively search for new sources, read the relevant information, and generate responses that are supported by evidence.

Another important point is that AWS emphasizes that developers can build AI Agents capable of retrieving information from the web without having to manage search infrastructure or integrate third-party search APIs outside the AWS ecosystem.

This is particularly valuable for organizations that care about:

- Data governance.
- Information source management.
- Deploying AI Agents in enterprise environments.
- Reducing dependence on external services.
- Improving response reliability through cited sources.

In other words, Web Search not only allows AI Agents to "know more," but also enables them to stay up to date and produce responses that are better grounded in current information.

## 5. Real-World Applications

This capability can be applied to a wide variety of AI Agent systems.

For example:

- In customer service, an Agent can look up the latest product information, updated policies, or new service announcements before responding to customers.

- In market research, an Agent can collect industry trends, recent news, and market changes from multiple sources.

- In cybersecurity, an Agent can monitor newly disclosed vulnerabilities, security patches, and threat advisories.

- In enterprise environments, an Agent can combine internal business data with current web information to generate more comprehensive responses.

The common characteristic of these use cases is that the underlying information changes continuously over time. Therefore, an AI Agent that relies only on static knowledge will struggle to provide accurate responses. Web Search adds a dynamic knowledge layer that allows the Agent to stay current.
---

## Personal Perspective

What I find most interesting about Web Search on AgentCore is not simply that AI can search the web. The ability to search itself is not new.

What is new is that AWS has integrated this capability into a managed AI Agent platform that can work together with Gateway, Memory, Identity, Observability, and the other components of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

In the past, when building an AI Agent with web search capabilities, development teams usually had to integrate many different components on their own, such as search APIs, tool calling, logging, permission management, rate limiting, citation handling, content filtering, and policy enforcement.

With AgentCore, AWS is attempting to transform these complex infrastructure components into managed services, allowing developers to spend more time building business logic instead of maintaining supporting infrastructure.

In my opinion, this also reflects a familiar AWS pattern: when a particular technical challenge becomes common across many organizations, AWS packages the underlying operational complexity into a managed service so that developers can focus more on creating applications and delivering business value.

---

## Conclusion

Web Search on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is a highly noteworthy feature in today's rapidly evolving AI Agent landscape.

It addresses a real-world challenge: AI Agents cannot rely solely on static knowledge if they are expected to support tasks that require current, verifiable, and continuously updated information.

By combining Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, AgentCore Gateway, and the Web Search Tool, organizations can enable AI Agents to:

- Retrieve up-to-date information from the web.
- Generate responses that are better grounded and supported by citations.
- Reduce the effort required to integrate and maintain external search APIs.
- Better meet the requirements of enterprise environments.
- Expand the practical use cases of AI Agents across a wide range of business scenarios.

From my perspective, this is an exciting step forward because it demonstrates how AI Agents are evolving from "chatbots that answer questions" into intelligent systems that can search for information, stay up to date, and make decisions based on newly available knowledge.

I would be delighted to hear your thoughts and feedback, especially from those who are interested in AI Agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), or systems that depend on real-time information.
